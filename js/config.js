 * Castle configuration.
 *
 * Uses the SAME shared Supabase project as the other games — the leaderboard
 * `scores` table is namespaced by `gameId`, so Castle's board is separate.
 * The publishable key is public by design and safe to embed; the database is
 * protected by the row-level-security policies in docs/supabase.sql. Blank the
 * URL/key to fall back to a local (per-browser) leaderboard.
